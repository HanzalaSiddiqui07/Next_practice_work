JavaScript: JavaScript is the programming language of the web. It program the behavior of the webpages.

Basic concepts of JavaScript along with examples:

- Variables: Variables are containers for storing data values. You can declare variables using the var, let, or const keywords.

Examples:

var name = "Hanzala";
let age = 25;
const g = 9.8;

- Data Types: JavaScript supports several data types including numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, objects, and more.

Examples:

let number = 10;
let text = "Hello";
let isTrue = true;
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
let person = { name: "John", age: 30 };


- Functions: Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task.

Examples:

function greet(name) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

greet("John");

- Conditional Statements: Conditional statements execute different actions based on different conditions.

Examples:

let num = 10;

if (num > 0) {
    console.log("Positive number");
} else if (num < 0) {
    console.log("Negative number");
} else {
    console.log("Zero");
}

- Loops: Loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code.

Examples:

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log("Iteration " + i);
}

let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
for (let fruit of fruits) {
    console.log(fruit);
}

- Arrays: Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.

Examples:

let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
console.log(fruits[0]); // Output: apple
console.log(fruits.length); // Output: 3

- Objects: Objects are used to store collections of key-value pairs.

Examples:

let person = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    city: "New York"
};
console.log(person.name); // Output: John

- Events: Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are programming. JavaScript can respond to these events.

Examples:

HTML:
<button id="myButton">Click me</button>

JavaScript:
document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
    console.log("Button clicked!");
});
